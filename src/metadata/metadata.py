##ToDo
## all functions concerning creating, saving, and modifying of the query metadata


##ToDo
## remember, if target metadata is modified (i.e. fields are added),
## unless it is a complete reload
## we should modify target storage
## and be careful because it might affect other queries to the same data target
## and if it is a complete reload we should(?) clear or move outdated data to something like ".old" tables
